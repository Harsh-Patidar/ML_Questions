What is the loss function in YOLO? 

ðŸ’¡ YOLO uses a sum of squared error between the predictions and the ground truth to calculate the loss. The loss function composes of:
The Classification loss.
The Localization loss (errors between the predicted boundary box and the ground truth).
The Confidence loss (the objectness of the box).
Loss function = classification loss + localization loss + confidence loss


What is the advantage of two-stage methods?
ðŸ’¡ In two-stage methods like R-CNN, they first predict a few candidate object locations and then use a
convolutional neural network to classify each of these candidate object locations as one of the classes or as background


What is the main problem faced with Single-shot methods?[src][src]
ðŸ’¡ Single-shot methods like SSD suffer from extremely by class imbalance. SSD resamples the ratio of the object class and
background class during training so it will not be overwhelmed by an image background
