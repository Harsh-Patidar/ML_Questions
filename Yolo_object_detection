What is the loss function in YOLO? [src]

ðŸ’¡ YOLO uses a sum of squared error between the predictions and the ground truth to calculate the loss. The loss function composes of:

The Classification loss.
The Localization loss (errors between the predicted boundary box and the ground truth).
The Confidence loss (the objectness of the box).
Loss function = classification loss + localization loss + confidence loss
